# art_utils
A small python module that abstracts away some of the frequent tasks performed in generative art.

## Purpose
This module holds a collection of helper functions and classes that make generative art scripts look a bit cleaner.
It also seeks to simplify frequent tasks such as building gradients or doing linear interpolation inside a matrix of data.
